# Controls
Controls come in 2 configurations for driver and 1 configuration for operator. Driver configurations are labeled "Forza" and "Classic." Forza controls use the left and right triggers for throttle while the classic controls use the left thumbstick for throttle.

## Driver
 - Classic:
    - Throttle: Left Thumbstick (y-axis)
    - Turn: Right Thumbstick (x-axis)
    - Quick Turn: Right trigger
    - Creep Mode: Left Trigger (robot drives a lot slower in this mode)

## Forza
