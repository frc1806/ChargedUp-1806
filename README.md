# ChargedUp-1806
FRC 1806's code for the 2023 competition season

## What's New
Biggest change was switching from an Iterative robot to a command based robot. Also we made major changes to our code. We no longer use most of the libraries that we once used and now use a lot of official WPIlib classes. Lastly, basic documentation is now provided for our fabrication and drive team, might add more for the general public whenever the robot is more closer to being finished. Documentation is found under the `/documentation` folder.
